# PICUP_Publication_Codeshare

This Github Repository hosts the code used for the submitted journal article ``Characterizing Faculty Online Learning Community Interactions Using Social Network Analysis" by Emily Bolger, Marius Nwobi, and Dr. Marcos (Danny) Caballero. 

(Emily should provide a sample file structure (or at least some sample networks for the plots discussed)

# The Data 
For this code, a user will need a node list and a edge list. For our Slack data, this looks like a list of the users that have joined each of the channels ('filename here') and a spreadsheet of the messages for a single channel. We have attached the edgelists for the three channels that we mention in the paper - Advanced Thermodynamics ('filename'), Jupyter ('filename'), and Classroom Pedagogy ('filename'). 

As a note, we have deidentified our data, so that it can be shared with the community safely. If you plan on working with Slack Data, you can obtain the Slack Username and Real Names associated to a specific Slack ID.

# What the Code Contains
only have network making code, not json to excel or excel to multiple messages (maybe we should include it all) 


# Pieces of the Code
highlight specific functions like randomizations pieces that could be pulled out. specific graphs or metric calculations. 

# How to Run the Code

My initial thought is using Canvas assignments for smaller assignments throughout the semester so they get practice with computational ""short essays"" - not exactly what you presented, just answering questions related to course activities.  (Having them within Canvas makes grading &amp; providing feedback much easier for me.) They would do a longer computational essay more like what you presented towards the end of the semester.  They can submit it via Canvas, but I'll talk to them about how they can just copy the html code of their submission to put on a website and/or to be sure to save it for portfolio/showcase purposes.

I just had a thought that I can have them *also* submit the html code to me so I can post it on a department or course website  (and maybe have the students in our gen ed physics courses provide an evaluation of the essay?).  We have a Physics Festival at the end of the semester where all our intro students from different courses get together to showcase their research projects so it would be nice to have the essays visible there via a website.",UJF6E99FF,,0,trinket,FALSE

I can create a python 3 Trinket that lets me use the `input()` function to get keyboard input from the user, but I don’t seem to be able to import vpython into that. Or, I can create a GlowScript Trinket that does VPython, but doesn’t recognize the `input()` statement. Does anyone know of a way to get both?

8/3/19,7:47:39,U1YKH1T96,,"<@UF0SNUWLE> I think using numpy or any other major Python package in Trinket means that the code must be run on a server instead of in the browser, (Running in the browser just means the code is first transpiled to JavaScript. Running on the server means it’s a bonafide Python kernel running the code. They have ported some packages to run in the browser, but not all.)  This is a Premium feature of Trinket, but that’s not necessarily a hard hurdle to cross. The technical challenge is that the Trinket developers will have to install VPython on the server. Then they will have to deal with piping the vpython scene to the trinket. This seems to me to not be very different from Jupyter. Nonetheless, it will take additional development by the Trinket people. I suggest asking them for this feature. But if there’s not a huge user base who will pay for this Premium feature, then I don’t think it’ll make it to the top of their to-do list.",UF0SNUWLE,,0,trinket,FALSE

So I took one of them and broke them down into smaller steps in Trinket. Also, it is not possible in Glowscript (yet) to just share just the execution of the problem. In Trinket, this is possible, so I can tell the students what the “correct” solution should look like, more or less.

Last spring, I had students submit trinkets via a trinket course (I have premium trinket account).

I know trinkets can be embedded in Canvas, so I was thinking that I could embed a trinket in a Canvas new quizzes ""passage""-type question (this allows the trinket to be on screen along with the questions).  (To clarify, this would be an assignment using the new quizzes tool not a ""quiz"".)

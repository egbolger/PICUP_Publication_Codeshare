6/22/17,12:02:58,U4M7UH1QW,,"Hope you are all having a happy and productive summer!  Nice to see your prospectus, Steve.         A couple years ago one of my Computers in Physics students did a computational project on modeling an astable multivibrator (clock circuit with 4 resistors, 2 transistors, 2 capacitors), using the Ebers-Moll model for the transistors, but that was EXTREMELY difficult and frustrating, because the abrupt switching was very difficult to capture with elementary methods for solving the time evolution differential equations.

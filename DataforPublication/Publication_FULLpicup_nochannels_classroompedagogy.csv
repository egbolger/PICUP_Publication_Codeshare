This provides an example of giving students a first experience with computing by giving them a somewhat sophisticated program (which uses arrays, loops, and array indices), but with a few specific lines that say ""insert ___ here"".
I am posting this here in the ""pedagogy"" channel in the hopes that this might prompt a discussion about the different ways that people handle both (1) the scaffolding of activities, and (2) their learning goals as they pertain to computation.",U721GN133,,0,classroom_pedagogy,FALSE

There's a bunch of different ways to do that: think-pair-share questions sprinkled throughout a ""lecture"" (relatively low effort for instructor) to Think Aloud Pair Problem Solving (medium effort) to a flipped classroom (lots of effort).   (Flipping my class was one of the best things I've ever done for my students to get them to discuss/apply physics.)  If lecture/note-taking is important to you, you can give your students ""skeleton notes"" or some guiding questions that they should be able to answer during/after lecture (not for points, necessarily, but to study from).  Those guiding questions are also great if there's discussion happening and you want them to take notes as they discuss.  As you do examples, make the students make some of those decisions.  You can also refer your students to Saundra McGuire's Study Cycle (it's about studying in general, but it provides some great tips on how class notes fit into an overall framework for studying.)",UBMBY393N,,0,classroom_pedagogy,FALSE

Students seem to believe that doing it all themselves is not learning.  If it all comes from within, then somehow it must have already been there.  Nothing new was acquired.  For today's students, learn and develop are completely unrelated concepts.  Learning is considered very similar to memorizing in that the source must be outside of the individual.  This seems to be why so many students have such trouble moving from memorizing to understanding.  A lecture can be memorized.  An active learning session has very little to memorize beyond initial instructions.  Quantifying is important in today's world.  I can quantify what I have memorized from a lecture.  I cannot quantify what I have understood from active learning.  I might not even be able to describe what I learn until I find words to fit the new concepts.",UKV3ZR9J5,,0,classroom_pedagogy,TRUE

The Calculus-based Physics: Mechanics course has just passed conservation and collisions.  We have started on rotational motion, just getting ready to talk about rotational kinetic energy.  Many equations look almost the same as translational motion.  Much of the mathematics is the same.  The physical reality it represents is really quite different.  One ""memorization"" corresponds to two ""understandings"" that look and feel quite different.  They realize that torque is very much like force but at the same time very different.  Mathematics and memorization cannot resolve this confusion, but understanding can.  I am contemplating modeling two masses at opposite ends of a massless rod.  One feels a single force for a short time.  The force from the rod is whatever is needed to prevent the rod from changing length, to keep the velocities parallel to the rod equal.  Perpendicular velocities will be what they will be.  Of course, Newton's 3rd Law must be maintained between the two masses.  This can show the situation from an x-y frame of reference.  Treating the object as one device with the pivot as the center of mass can show how the push and pull between the masses works in a way that agrees with an accelerating center of mass and rotation around the center of mass from an r-theta frame of reference.

10/20/19,10:58:00,UJNH8230Q,,"There's an interesting issue here. Consider a rigid rod lying at rest on a low-friction surface. Hit it with a sharp blow at one end, perpendicular to the rod. Using both momentum and angular momentum one can show that, surprisingly, the other end of the rod moves initially in a direction opposite to the applied impulsive force. However, thanks to relativity, there cannot be such a thing as a ""rigid body"", as that would imply an infinite speed of sound, and no delay between hitting one end of the rod and the other end moving. Here is a little program in which a non-rigid rod, consisting of atoms in a body-centered structure with spring-like forces between neighboring atoms, is struck an impulsive blow:

<https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/NAME/folder/Pub/program/HitStickAtEnd>

At the speed of sound in this rod, the disturbance propagates to the far end of the rod, and the far end initially moves in the SAME direction as the impulsive force, but an instant later moves in the opposite direction. The center of mass of the rod is re-calculated in every time step and a red dot marks this calculated center of mass, which as expected moves with a constant velocity. This program does NOT calculate torques and angular momentum; it is sufficient simply to continually apply delta-p = Fnet*delta-t to each of the atoms. This suggests that in classical mechanics angular momentum is not truly fundamental. It certainly is fundamental in quantum mechanics, because even a point-like object such as the electron has angular momentum and responds to torques. At the bottom of the page, note the references to articles about these issues.

<https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/NAME/folder/Pub/program/HitStickAtEnd>

At the speed of sound in this rod, the disturbance propagates to the far end of the rod, and the far end initially moves in the SAME direction as the impulsive force, but an instant later moves in the opposite direction. The center of mass of the rod is re-calculated in every time step and a red dot marks this calculated center of mass, which as expected moves with a constant velocity. This program does NOT calculate torques and angular momentum; it is sufficient simply to continually apply delta-p = Fnet*delta-t to each of the atoms. This suggests that in classical mechanics angular momentum is not truly fundamental. It certainly is fundamental in quantum mechanics, because even a point-like object such as the electron has angular momentum and responds to torques.

At the speed of sound in this rod, the disturbance propagates to the far end of the rod, and the far end initially moves in the SAME direction as the impulsive force, but an instant later moves in the opposite direction. The center of mass of the rod is re-calculated in every time step and a red dot marks this calculated center of mass, which as expected moves with a constant velocity. This program does NOT calculate torques and angular momentum; it is sufficient simply to continually apply delta-p = Fnet*delta-t to each of the atoms. This suggests that in classical mechanics angular momentum is not truly fundamental. It certainly is fundamental in quantum mechanics, because even a point-like object such as the electron has angular momentum and responds to torques.

10/20/19,10:58:00,UJNH8230Q,,"There's an interesting issue here. Consider a rigid rod lying at rest on a low-friction surface. Hit it with a sharp blow at one end, perpendicular to the rod. Using both momentum and angular momentum one can show that, surprisingly, the other end of the rod moves initially in a direction opposite to the applied impulsive force. However, thanks to relativity, there cannot be such a thing as a ""rigid body"", as that would imply an infinite speed of sound, and no delay between hitting one end of the rod and the other end moving. Here is a little program in which a non-rigid rod, consisting of atoms in a body-centered structure with spring-like forces between neighboring atoms, is struck an impulsive blow:

<https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/NAME/folder/Pub/program/HitStickAtEnd>

At the speed of sound in this rod, the disturbance propagates to the far end of the rod, and the far end initially moves in the SAME direction as the impulsive force, but an instant later moves in the opposite direction. The center of mass of the rod is re-calculated in every time step and a red dot marks this calculated center of mass, which as expected moves with a constant velocity. This program does NOT calculate torques and angular momentum; it is sufficient simply to continually apply delta-p = Fnet*delta-t to each of the atoms. This suggests that in classical mechanics angular momentum is not truly fundamental. It certainly is fundamental in quantum mechanics, because even a point-like object such as the electron has angular momentum and responds to torques.

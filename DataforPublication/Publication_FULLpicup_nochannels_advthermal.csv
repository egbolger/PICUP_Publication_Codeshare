4/11/17,21:45:57,U1YKN36HF,,<@U243ZCBUZ> would you like to join the <#C1YLDG0S3|advanced_thermal> channel?,U243ZCBUZ,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
4/12/17,8:16:54,U1YEMA4BA,,"Hi <@U1YKN36HF> , I am teaching advanced thermal physics right now using Dan Schroder's book, which is very good.  He actually has several homework problems in his book that are numerical in nature, which is nice.  I also have assigned several homework assignments that are ""heavier"" in computation, including molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo (Ising model), and heat transfer (numerically solving a PDE).",U1YKN36HF,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
4/12/17,10:11:45,U1YKKMTFE,,<@U243ZCBUZ> and I messed around last semester with some computational thermal problems from Mark Newman's book <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/computational-physics/>,U243ZCBUZ,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
4/12/17,12:13:12,U4AG8DTQA,,"I taught undergraduate statistical physics last fall.  There is a separate thermo course that's a prerequisite.  For a text I used both Schroeder (which students should have already bought for thermo) and Blundell &amp; Blundell (for its coverage of kinetic theory, thermal transport, and linear response).  I assigned some of the numerical problems out of Schroeder that <@U1YEMA4BA> alluded to, but because my students had no common ""toolkit"" (sadly our program is lacking any regular computational component at this point---I have been lurking in PICUP to get ideas for revising our curriculum) I didn't feel any larger-scale computational projects would be manageable.",U1YEMA4BA,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
4/14/17,18:11:54,U243ZCBUZ,,"<@U1YKN36HF> I'm using Schroeder for my course. One of the reasons I picked him (in addition to the clarity of his exposition) was for the computational exercises that he includes (especially in chapters 2 and 3). I included many of these computational exercises among the set of challenge problems from which my students could pick for their final project (though only one group picked a CM problem)

One of the big CM projects I had my students to was to create a model of the heat capacity of an Einstein solid and compare the results to actual data of lead and aluminum. (I ~stole~ adapted this problem from Matter and Interactions). 

I also put together a worksheet designed to walk students through using CM to compute Boltzmann statistics (including partition function, average energy, heat capacity, etc) using hydrogen as a test case. We'll be doing that next week and I can report back then. 

One thing I regret not doing was to model a random walk. Here is a Trinket I build to simulate the Drude model (note the constant average velocity in an electric field), which I might design an activity around the next time I teach stat phys. <https://trinket.io/glowscript/7fe2554cc3>",U1YKN36HF,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
4/17/17,21:31:55,U4AG8DTQA,,"If you're looking for that sort of application, of ideas from stat mech to other disciplines, I'd recommend starting with simulated annealing as a way to find ""good enough"" solutions to difficult minimization problems.",U1YKN36HF,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
4/19/17,13:38:02,U1YKN36HF,,<@U1YEMA4BA> Do you like doing thermo before statistics? It seems to me a better story if you go from microscopic properties to macroscopic properties; this is what attracted me to Gould and Tobochnik. What do you think are the pros / cons of either approach (thermo before stats or the other way around)?,U1YEMA4BA,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
2/6/18,21:22:52,U1YEMA4BA,,"Hi <@U1YKN36HF>.  Yes, they are using units where all positions are in units of (or divided by) ""sigma"" energies are in units of ""epsilon"" etc.  (It is the same thing in both their STP and CSM textbooks, and in Ch. 16 of Rubin Landau's book -- all of which are available on ComPADRE.)  Here is a table listing these units that I got from one of these books...I don't recall which.  So to turn a simulated value into SI units, you would multiply by the value of ""sigma"" or ""epsilon"" etc. The 0 th file name and title is image.png; image.png.",U1YKN36HF,,0,advanced_thermal,FALSE
